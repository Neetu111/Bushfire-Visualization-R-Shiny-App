This shapefile is derived from MODIS images by the Darwin Centre for Bushfire Research, Charles Darwin University. It is provided in the projection GCS_GDA_1994.

This shapefile includes all fire scars identified in 2019 across the Australian rangelands within the geographic limits described in the abstract of the attached metadata txt file. 

This dataset has pixels aligned to the same grid as the other NAFI annual fire scar layers.

The shapefile polygons have the following attributes:

FID: feature identifier - a unique identifier for the ploygon (outlined shape displayed on the map).

Region: the region that the polygon is in. There are six regions that cover most of Australia's rangelands - Western Australia north of latitude 21 S and east of longitude 121 E (WAN); Western Australia southern rangelands (WAS); Northern Territory (NT); South Australian rangelands (SA); Far north Queensland down to around 20 S plus the Mackay region (QLDN); the rest of Queensland (QLDS).  

Update_No: a number between 1 and 255 that identifies each fire scar mapping update. There can be a maximum of 255 mapping updates a year for each of the broad regional groups WAN/WAS, NT/SA and QLDN/QLDS.

Map_period: the dates between which the polygon has been detected as being burnt. Note some polygons list more than one map period and region combination - use the location of the polygon on the map to identify the region and the correct map period.

Month: the allocated month number (January = 1, February= 2 etc.) indicating the month in which the fire scar mapped by the polygon was detected as being burnt.The allocated month is determined by the month that fills most of the map period.

The data is also available as a download in geotiff image format.

Details of the process for mapping fire scars is available on the NAFI website www.firenorth.org.au. More information on the mapping process and data reliability can be obtained from the Darwin Centre for Bushfire Research (see email contact below).
