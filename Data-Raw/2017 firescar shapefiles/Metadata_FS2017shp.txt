Abstract Shapefile of fire affected areas in northern Australia and Western Australia for the year 2017 based on NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. The data are vector ploygons derived from an image with a resolution of 250m per pixel and each polygon is tagged with a number of attributes including the mapping interval in which the burnt area within the polygon was detected and the month that covers the largest part of the mapping interval. The data extends across the WA rangelands (down to 34.5 degrees S), across the entire NTand northern Qld (down to around 20 degrees S) and across the north of SA down to 29 degrees S. The data also include all fire scars in the high rainfall zone around Townsville and fire scars from January 1st to March 31st across Queensland south of 20S. Mapping landscapes north of 20 degrees S has been validated by aerial and on-ground transects across northern Australia.

Lineage Statement Burnt area mapping is based on analysis of imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on NASA’s Terra satellite. At least two images of different dates are compared to detect fire affected areas. Image analysing software, manual inspection of the image and other datasets such as hotspot data are used to produce the final product.
